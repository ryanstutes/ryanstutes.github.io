            <p>Hey &#128075; I'm Stutes!</p>
            <p><strong>I’m seeking a hands on role where I can leverage my unique blend of technical breadth and people skills to lead high-performing teams and projects to deliver value at scale. </strong></p>

                    <p>I live in Chicago with my partner and our two dogs. I like to hike, camp, kayak, ski, play tennis, walk my dogs (read: be outside), listen to podcasts/audiobooks, play video games, and learn new things. I strive to spend a most of my energy on things that make people's lives better.</p>
